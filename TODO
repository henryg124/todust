This project should be a TODO list CLI application. Users should have the ability to:

- Add an item to a todo list
- Store multiple todo lists (to categorise)
- Prioritise items
- Display lists
- Remove items
- Save lists to file (path should be given when first run)
- Assume todo list is localized to current user on 1 machine (for now)

Features:
- CLAP parser (run with list, add, delete by ID, update)
- GUI? (Would allow adding/updating/deleting more fluid)
